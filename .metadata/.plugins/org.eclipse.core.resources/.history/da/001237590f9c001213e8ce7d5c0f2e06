 * 
 * method: 
 * if the start of column is greater than the element, then x is to the left of the column
 * if the end of column  is less than the element , then x is to the right of the column
 * if the start of the row is greater than the element, the x is above the row
 * if the end of the row is less than the element , then x is below the row
